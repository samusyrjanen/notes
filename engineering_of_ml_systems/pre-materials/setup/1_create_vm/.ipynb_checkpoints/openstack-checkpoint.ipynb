    "# Create a Virtual Machine in CSC cPouta\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to create a virtual machine in cPouta.\n",
    "\n",
    "> cPouta and ePouta are the IaaS cloud services at CSC, known as Finnish IT center for science. The cPouta cloud is the public cloud which is easily accessible via the internet. The ePouta cloud is a virtual private cloud designed to meet the security requirements of handling sensitive data. Both the cPouta and ePouta clouds run on the OpenStack cloud software. The Pouta cloud services are suitable for most kinds of computational workloads and any other supporting services these workloads might need.\n",
    "[Source](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/pouta-what-is/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## First glance at cPouta\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to create and manage a virtual machine from our local computer using openstack CLI, but you can start familizarizing with cPouta GUI reading [this guide](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui/).\n",

    "To be able to connect to the CSC system and cPouta, we need to get some credentials.\n",
    "We can set them using a script provided in the OpenStack web interface.\n",

    "**NOTE**: Unfortunately we cannot run the OpenStack CLI in the python notebook because we will need the credentials from the openrc file, so you will need to open a terminal and follow along with the terminal on the side. This will be easy if you use VSCode. If you don't want to switch between here and the terminal, you can skip this section and just use the OpenStack API with python.\n",
