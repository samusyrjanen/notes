    "# An introduction to the MLOps platform\n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "The overview of the MLOps platform is illustrated in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/overview.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLOps platform has three main components: Kubeflow Pipelines, MLflow, and KServe. \n",
    "\n",
    "**[Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/introduction/)** is an open-source ML task orchestrator. It allows users to define an ML pipeline, which is a way to codify and automate a set of predefined tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment, to produce an ML model. Kubeflow Pipelines allows for managing the dependencies and execution orders of tasks. Kubeflow Pipelines runs atop a Kubernetes cluster and can run multiple ML pipelines in parallel by leveraging the resources of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)** is an open-source platform for managing ML experiments. It is used to record model training metadata (e.g., hyperparameters), training datasets, and metrics (e.g., the evaluation metrics obtained when the model is evaluated against a testing dataset). MLflow also provides the feature of saving model artifacts in a central place. In the MLOps platform, MLflow is deployed as a service, which provides endpoints for recording model training metadata and saving model artifacts. As shown in the figure above, MLflow uses a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/) as metadata store for saving the training metadata and an [MinIO storage](https://min.io/) as an artifact store for persisting training artifacts, e.g. model artifacts, text, and datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**[KServe](https://kserve.github.io/website/0.10/)** is an open-source model serving platform built atop Kubernetes. It is designed to simplify the deployment and management of machine learning models in production environments. KServe leverages Kubernetes to provide the necessary infrastructure and capabilities for deploying and scaling ML models. In more details, upon receiving a model deployment request, KServe fetches the model artifact from defined storage (the MinIO storage service in our platform). It then packages the model artifact as a container and provides HTTP and gRPC APIs for querying predictions. KServe supports a wide range of model formats by default, such as SKLearn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. \n",

    "### Install needed packages\n",
    "Before going through the tutorials, you need to install the Python packages needed for this course. \n"

You'll also learn how to use [Deepchecks](https://docs.deepchecks.com/stable/getting-started/welcome.html) to evaluate a trained model.
