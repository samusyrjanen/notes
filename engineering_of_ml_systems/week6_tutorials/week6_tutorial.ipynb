    "Deploying a model to production is not the end. We need to continually monitor the model to make sure it still performs as expected after being deployed to production. From a high level, model monitoring includes two types: 1) service-level monitoring, such as the resource (CPU/GPU/memory) usage and the response latency/status of the inference service, and 2) model-level monitoring, such as the prediction error, target and data drift. \n",
